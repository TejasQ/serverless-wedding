# `serverless-wedding`

This project is the source code of my talk at [Codemotion Rome](https://events.codemotion.com/conferences/rome/2019/speaker/5168/) that discusses an app made up of serverless lambdas that retrieves its stateful parts from an external service.

This is a full CRUD application to demonstrate working with serverless architectures, is a proof of concept, and is not necessarily production-ready: there is no error handling, for instance.

It's just a tutorial/demo.

## It Uses

- [Hasura](https://hasura.io) for the database + API
- [React](https://reactjs.org) on [Next](https://nextjs.org/) for the UI
- [Now](https://now.sh) for cloud deployment

I hope it adds value to your experience as a developer around serverless.
